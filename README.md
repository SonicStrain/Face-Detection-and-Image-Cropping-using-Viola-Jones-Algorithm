# Face-Detection-and-Image-Cropping-using-Viola-Jones-Algorithm
Automatic Face detection and cropping of images using Viola Jones Algorithm from folder to folder.

## Prerequisite : MATLAB or OCTAVE

## Description :

### Viola Jones Algorithm : This algorithm is devloped by Paul Viola and Michel Jones back in 2001. A framework based on it can detect objects in images quickly and efficiently.

### vision.CascadeObjectDetector : This is a cascade object detector which uses Viola Jones algorithm to detect people's faces.

### Usage Instructions:

To generate folder to folder results:

1. Paste the folder containing Images in the directory.
2. Go to the 'Get_image.m' file and enter the location of the folder containing images (ImgFol = '')
3. Create a new folder and enter the location of that folder.(ImgLoc = '')
